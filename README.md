Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique in deep learning that combines the content of one image with the style of another image to create a new, stylized image.

How It Works:

Content Image: The image that provides the structure or layout (e.g., a photo of a cityscape).

Style Image: The image that provides the artistic style (e.g., a Van Gogh painting).

Output Image: The generated image that preserves the content of the content image and the artistic style of the style image.
